# smart-campus-project
This repository contains the code and resources for the Smart Campus Project.
Some of the backend files (mainly the php files) are AI assisted, as we did not get enough practice on PHP.
The database is AI generated and some of the SQL queries are also AI generated.
The frontend is NOT AI generated, the only thing AI helped in was the colors, as we could not make something that visually appealing, all the css placements and displays are NOT AI generated.
